# Project Breakdown

Introduction (Assigned to Christian)

Describe your data set. Provide proper motivation for your work.

- What questions are you trying to answer?
- How did you prepare and clean the data?

EDA/Unsupervised Analysis (Assigned to Christian)

- Is there any interesting structure present in the data?
- What were your findings

- Visualize
  -compare boxplots of control vs case for each protein

- Correlation Plot
  - visualize what the correlation is between variables

- PCA
  - visualize scree plot
  - visualize first vs second principal component

* If you cannot find anything interesting, then describe what you tried and show that there isnâ€™t much visible structure. 

Models

- What predictor variables did you include?

**Models to use:**

- Logistic-LASSO (Assigned to Christian)
- KNN (Assigned to Justin)
- Random Forest/Bagging (Assigned to Rebekah)
- Boosting (AdaBoost?) (Assigned to Justin)
- SVM (Assigned to Rebekah)

**For each of the models:**

- What techniques did you use
- why did you choose it? 
- What assumptions, if any, are being made by using this technique?
- If there were tuning parameters, how did you pick their values?
- What are the limitations of the models you used (if there are any)?

**After all of the models have been tuned:** (Assigned to Christian)

- How did you conduct model selection?
- Explain/visualize the final model you select.
- Which variables play important roles in predicting the response?

- Discuss the training/test performance if you have a test data set.

Conclusion (Assigned to Christian)

- What were your findings? 
- Are they what you expect? 
- What insights into the data can you make?
